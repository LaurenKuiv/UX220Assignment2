### Greenhouse Laborer


- I picked flowers and packaged them for customers.

- I did this for four years from age 12 to 17.

- I gained experience in the workforce and made friends.

- I worked with my best friends from highschool and we always sang.

- I didn't enjoy the unsufferable heat in the summer.

- I give this experience a "C"
