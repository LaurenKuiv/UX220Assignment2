### Factory worker at Bos Smoked Fish

- I packaged smoked fish with two other people. 

- I worked here last summer.

- The hours were great and consistent.

- My favorite part was eating endless amounts of smoked salmon.

- I hated this job with a passion because my coworkers were rude and racist.

- I give this experience an "F"
