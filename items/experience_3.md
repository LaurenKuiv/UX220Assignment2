### Service Coordinator at Premier Equipment

- I worked at Premier Equipment and made a trucking schedule and did book work

- I worked here for less than a year, from age 18 to 19

- I met my boyfriend here and made some friends

- I occasionally delivered parts to customers and it was amazing. It gave me an excuse to leave the shop.

- A customer once called me stupid over the phone for not hearing how he spelt his name. The job also became very boring.

- I give this experience a "B"
