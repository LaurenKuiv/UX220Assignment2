### McDonalds

- I worked at McDonalds at a crew member. 

- I worked here from age 17 to 18

- It was a fun job that taught me how to work with customers

- My manager cooked wings and fries for me

- A customer tried to throw sweet and sour sauce at me because I told him he had a flat tire

- I give this experience a "B"
